    <br><h1><h1 style="text-align: center;">OOP Principles in Calculator program</h1>
	<p> OOP or object-oriented programming is a model of programming that designs software around the organization of objects and data rather than functions and logic. Our calculator program is written based on the 4 core OOP principles discussed below.</p> <br>
	<b><p class="lead">ENCAPSULATION</p></b> <br>
	<p>
    Encapsulation is the idea that describes wrapping attributes and behavior into a class.
	Objects are instances of a class. When an object is instantiated, it encapsulates its variables and functions from the class into a single unit.
	Typically, variables in a class are set to private and can only be modified by public functions that can be used outside the class in order to avoid accidental change of the variables. <br><br>
    An example of encapsulation in our calculator program is in our calculations class:<br><br>
	<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/calculations.py.jpg') }}" alt="calculations.py" class="center" style="width:100%;"><br>
	<b><i>Note:</b></i> The full calculations class can be viewed here: <a href="https://github.com/tlr24/calc_project/blob/main/calculator/history/calculations.py">https://github.com/tlr24/calc_project/blob/main/calculator/history/calculations.py</a> (Full script not shown here).<br><br><br>
	In our example, we can see that we create a Calculations class on line 8. On line 11, we give our Calculations class a list variable names history to store our calcuation history.
	We also define several methods including <code>add_calculation()</code> (line 14), <code>clear_history()</code> (line 20), <code>get_calculation()</code>(line 26), and <code>remove_calculation()</code> (line 36) that modify our history variable by appending, clearing, returning, and removing from it.
	When a Calculations object is instantiated from the Calculations class, it acts as a single unit that encapsulates the history variable and all of its functions that can alter the history variable.
	<br><br><br></p>
	<b><p class="lead">INHERITANCE</p></b> <br>
	<p>
    Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits the data and behavior from another class. The class that is being inherited from is called the <b>parent</b> or base class. The class that is inheriting from the parent class is called the <b>child</b> class. <br><br>
	An example of inheritance in our calculator program is in the Calculation and Addition classes. 
	The Calculation class acts as the parent/base class. <br>
	<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/calculation.py.jpg') }}" alt="calculation.py" class="center" style="width:100%;"><br>
	The Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division classes all inherit the properties and methods from the Calculation class.
	<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/addition.py.jpg') }}" alt="addition.py" class="center" style="width:100%;"><br>
	As seen when defining the Addition class (line 5), the Addition class inherits from the Calculation class (likewise in the other operation classes). 
	This means that the Addition class inherits the values property, <code>__init__</code> method, <code>create</code> factory method, and <code>convert_args_to_list_float</code> method. 
	As seen on line 10 of the Addition class, the <code>get_result</code> method is able to read from the self.values property that is inherited from the Calculation class in the Addition class. <br><br>
	Inheritance allows for re-usability of code as it allows derived classes to add new features on top of a base class.<br><br>
	<b><i>Note:</b></i> The full Calculation class can be viewed here: <a href="https://github.com/tlr24/calc_project/blob/main/calculator/operations/calculation.py">https://github.com/tlr24/calc_project/blob/main/calculator/operations/calculation.py</a>.
	All of the operation classes can be viewed here: <a href="https://github.com/tlr24/calc_project/tree/main/calculator/operations">https://github.com/tlr24/calc_project/tree/main/calculator/operations</a>.
	<br><br><br></p>
	<b><p class="lead">POLYMORPHISM</p></b> <br>
	<p>
    Polymorphism is the ability to use a common interface for multiple forms of data types.<br><br>
    An example of polymorphism in our calculator program is in our operation scripts: addition.py, substraction.py, multiplication.py, division.py.<br> 
	Let's first look at addition.py<br><br>
	<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/addition.py.jpg') }}" alt="addition.py" class="center" style="width:100%;"><br>
	Here we can see there the addition class inherits from the Calculation class. In the addition class, a method of <code>get_result()</code> is defined.<br><br>
	Now let's look at the subtraction.py<br>
	<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/subtraction.py.jpg') }}" alt="subtraction.py" class="center" style="width:100%;"><br>
	Here we see that there is a subtraction class defined that also inherits from the Calculation class. It also defines the same method called <code>get_result()</code>, however, it is getting the result for a different type of calculation: subtraction.
	This is an example of polymorphism where we use the same interface for different objects to make the code more efficient.<br><br>
	<b><i>Note:</b></i> All of the operation classes can be viewed here: <a href="https://github.com/tlr24/calc_project/tree/main/calculator/operations">https://github.com/tlr24/calc_project/tree/main/calculator/operations</a>.
	<br><br><br></p>
	<b><p class="lead">ABSTRACTION</p> </b> <br>
	<p>
    Abstraction focuses on hiding the internal implementations of a process or method from the user. <br><br>
	An example of abstraction in our calculator program is found in the calculator class. 
	In the calculator class, there are simple methods for basic calculator operations including <code>add_numbers</code>, <code>subtract_numbers</code>, <code>multiple_numbers</code>, and <code>divide_numbers</code>. <br><br>
	<img src="pictures/abstract.jpg" alt="abstract" class="center" style="width:100%;"><br>
	The actual code that does all the calculating for these methods is hidden behind the <code>add_addition_calculation</code> (etc.) methods found in the Calculations class which then inherits all the Addition, Subtraction, etc. classes that contain the methods with the actual code to do the calculations. <br><br>
	<a href="https://github.com/tlr24/calc_project/blob/main/calculator/history/calculations.py">Calculations.py</a>: <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/abstractCalculations.jpg') }}" alt="abstractCalculations" class="center" style="width:100%;"><br>
	<a href="https://github.com/tlr24/calc_project/blob/main/calculator/operations/addition.py">Addition.py</a>: <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/addition.py.jpg') }}" alt="addition.py" class="center" style="width:100%;"><br>
	The user only needs to call <code>add_numbers</code> to do their addition calculation as the actual code is hidden from them in the Addition class. 
	Abstraction makes it easier for the user to use the calculator interface with the easy calculation methods that hides the real code behind the operation. <br><br>
